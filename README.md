# Electric Vehicle Charge and Range Analysis Visualization Tool

This repository hosts a powerful visualization tool designed for analyzing electric vehicle (EV) charge and range data. The tool offers comprehensive insights into EV charging patterns, energy consumption, and driving range estimation, empowering both EV owners and infrastructure planners.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Visualize charging station locations, energy consumption patterns, and driving range estimates on an interactive map interface.
- **Real-time Data Integration**: Integrate real-time data sources to provide up-to-date information on charging station availability and energy pricing.
- **Range Prediction**: Predict driving range based on various factors such as terrain, weather conditions, and driving habits.
- **Optimal Route Planning**: Calculate and visualize optimal charging routes for EV trips to maximize range and minimize charging time.
- **Customizable Analysis**: Customize analysis parameters to suit specific user preferences and requirements.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built on a scalable architecture to handle large datasets and accommodate future expansions.
